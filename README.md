# Babosa

Babosa is an in-progress library that provides UTF-8-aware methods to
transliterate and truncate strings, and convert them into formats suitable for
use in URL's.

It is an extraction and improvement of the string code from
[FriendlyId](http://github.com/norman/friendly_id), intended to allow
developers to create plugins/libraries similar to FriendlyId.
